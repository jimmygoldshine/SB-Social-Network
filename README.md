# SB-Social-Network
A half-day attempt at a Social Network, in Ruby. To demonstrate the application I decided to experiment and build a command line interface (CLI) tutorial.

### To Run

* Fork and clone this repo. Once in the SB-Social-Network folder...
* Run ```$ bundle``` from the terminal to install gems.
* Use the command ```$ ruby social_network.rb``` to boot up the tutorial.
* Use the CLI to input user's names and to receive feedback as to what the application.
